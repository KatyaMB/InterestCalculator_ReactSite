# React website - an interest calculator
I created a React interest calculator from scratch.<br>
This website utilises React components and has been split into reusable components.<br>
It has input for the user to deposit money to the bank, input for the user to withdraw money from the bank, a button that the user can click to “add interest” to the account, a ﬁxed interest rate percentage in another input that is then added to the balance being displayed and a button that the user can click to “Charge bank fees”, that is then deducted from the displayed balance.
It also has shared states that are lifted to a parent component.
The website has been styles with custom CSS styles.

**To run the the site**
<br>
*In Terminal execute:* <br>
npm install (install the node modules) <br>
npm start (run the site) <br>

**Output**
